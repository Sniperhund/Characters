# PLESAE README!

I've used typescript in this, but I have transpiled it before uploading. So, you can run it in any environment.
Just remember if you want to see the code you need to open the typescript folder instead of the javascript one.

If you want to recompile it yourself just run `tsc` in the typescript folder.
To download it just run `npm install -g typescript` and reload your terminal PATH (most likely you have to restart vscode).
